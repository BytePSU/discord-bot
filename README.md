# Overview
BytePSU Bot (temporary name) is a Discord bot that automates the process of finding new internships for college students, without the need of any input. The Discord bot notifies when a new internship has been posted, with details regarding when it was posted, salary, requirements, and other information.

The bot currently only uses [levels.fyi's](https://levels.fyi/internships) internship lisitngs in order to fetch new internships. Later down the road, we will use multiple websites that will allow us to gather more internships.

Keep in mind that the bot is currently under heavy development.

This is the first collaborative project from BytePSU club.
# Requirements
This Discord uses [Python 3.11](python.org) and [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

A requirements.txt is included to download all of the packages in mass.

You will also need an Application through the Discord Development Portal in order to run the bot.
