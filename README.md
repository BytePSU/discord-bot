# Overview
Our Discord bot automates the process of finding new internships for college students. When a new internship entry is entered on [levels.fyi's](https://levels.fyi/internships) job board, a signal is sent to our bot to notify users of the new position. All necessary information is neatly packaged into one embedded message, with details regarding: 

- Salary
- Education Requirements
- Location
- And more

This is the first collaborative project from BytePSU club; expect more updates to come as we revisit this project in due time.
# Features
- Easy to use
- Fast, real-time updates
- Find positions at random
- Find positions from a specified index
